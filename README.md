# Caveat emptor
There is no guarantee of a working state. There are known missing features in the code. The graphical library means that the interface can be idiosyncratic. The program *should not* crash, but errors might pop up. Usually, they can be dismissed. Don't panic. Refer to issues, but also beware of *unknown* bugs. The system has only been fully tested on Ubuntu. On Windows, building from source is necessary, which can be problematic because the compilers are fragile.

Data provided may not be sufficient for well-defined classes, nor may the class system be entirely sound.
