# Caveat emptor

Not only is there no warranty or guarantee of a working state, there isn't even the expectation of a working state yet. There are known bugs and missing features in the code (refer to issues, but also beware of *unknown* bugs). The system has only been tested on Ubuntu.

Data provided may not be sufficient for well-defined classes, nor may the class system be entirely sound.
