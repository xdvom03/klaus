# What is this?

This is a project for the "maturita" exam from IT at Gymn√°zium Jana Keplera.

# How to use?

Download files. I use Portacle on Linux Ubuntu to run the program. I put a compressed version of the entire system (minus data, see below) in the repository as "system.zip". Install Portacle (https://portacle.github.io/) into the "portacle" folder inside. Load and compile all files in ordr specified by numbers (they are there to properly sort alphabetically). Run (redownload \*classes-folder\*) to fetch the required data. Edit the database by typing in (db) or use the program by typing in (run). Start by rebuilding the corpus. Then refer to the documentation.

# Caveat emptor

Not only is there no warranty or guarantee of a working state, there isn't even the expectation of a working state yet. There are known bugs and missing features in the code. There is a dependency on wish (tcl/tk window system). The system isn't tested on any other computers than my own and depends on a version of quicklisp from 2017-03-06.
