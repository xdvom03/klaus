# What is this?

This is a project for the "maturita" exam from IT at Gymn√°zium Jana Keplera.

# How to use?

Download files. I use Portacle on Linux Ubuntu to run the program. Install Portacle (https://portacle.github.io/) into a "portacle" folder at the level of "prog". Load and compile all files in order specified by numbers (they are there to properly sort alphabetically), or load the file "all". Run (redownload \*classes-folder\*) to fetch website data. Rebuild the corpus with (rebuild-corpus "/"). Then refer to the documentation.

# Caveat emptor

Not only is there no warranty or guarantee of a working state, there isn't even the expectation of a working state yet. There are known bugs and missing features in the code. There is a dependency on wish (tcl/tk window system). The system isn't tested on any other computers than my own and depends on a version of quicklisp from 2017-03-06 because of the LTK library.
