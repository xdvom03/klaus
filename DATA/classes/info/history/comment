"The border between history and politics lies in whether we can in some way affect what is being discussed.
This is not limited to political history.
Anything documenting events that are already complete (and cannot be affected anymore, though their consequences may continue into today) within their chronological context (this is crucial: an article about the Space Shuttle goes into the space class, unless the site talks about it as a part of what happened in the Cold War era).
Purely being old does not justify classing here. 

We currently only have ancient history classed.
