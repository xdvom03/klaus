"Content designed to be cheaply produced, SEO driven to the top for common search queries. Little to no thought is paid to the usefulness of the content.

Other mills besides Lifehack needed. Some may be completely useless, as they are often image-driven (as are quotes on Lifehack).

This folder is not defined by the content mill industry, but rather by vacuous writing. The fact that so much motivational talk is in here is only a correlation - it attracts a lot of vacuous writing and poor research."
