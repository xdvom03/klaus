"This section is somewhat dubious. The definition in the issue:

A fairly shallow article meant to engage laypeople for a while, then be dropped, providing at most an overview of an issue and an aggregation of data available elsewhere (this cuts investigative journalism out of the definition). It is distinct from content mills in being less advertising-focused, thus less SEO-focused and more often earning money through paywalled articles or donations.

The point seems not to be about news per se, but in the kind of opinion/interview/press-release/PR articles often published on news sites.

An actual news section may be useful as well (it would have to be filled in over a long time as news topics change!), but this content is of the more pernicious kind. The crawler will tell.
